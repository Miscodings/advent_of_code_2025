# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

welcome to my **Advent of Code (aoc) 2025** solutions repository!
this repo contains my _daily progress, solutions, and any utilities_ i build along the way.

aoc is an annual programming event created by __eric wastl__, featuring daily coding puzzles during the month of december. 
starting this year, there are only 12 puzzles every month. **BUT each puzzle has 2 parts, so technically there are 24 of them in total.**

**more info** ➜ https://adventofcode.com/2025

if you enjoy puzzles, algorithm challenges, or holiday-themed coding adventures, you should definitely join!

## 🧠 Languages & Tools

i’m solving 2025 using:
- c++ 20
- standard library only (no external dependencies)
- fast, readable, puzzle-oriented code
- occasional brute force, but optimized when necessary

## 🎯 Goals for AoC 2025
- complete all 24 stars ⭐
- write clean, reusable code
- use problem-solving approaches rather than over-engineering
- document tricky puzzles effectively
- improve my simulation, parsing, and algorithmic skills

## 🚀 Running the Solutions
- compile the program, but use your own input data!
- aoc will provide you with your own input data on its website, so be sure to adjust the directory path to include that as well.
